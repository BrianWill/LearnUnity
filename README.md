A video series covering the Unity game engine. Guide below, code examples in subdirectories.

## C#

- [lesson 0a, 16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnFXdkf69H8) static typing, classes 
- [lesson 0b, 13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmUwaR_nEqY) methods, constructors 
- [lesson 0c, 18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cinkGgfTKU0) interfaces, inheritance 
- [lesson 0d, 16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGwTRQ6DW9E) structs, properties, generics 
- [lesson 0e, 10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rvfbV0XX5E) syntax 

I don't recommend diving into Unity until you have a basic familiarity with C# (or Java, which is similar enough).

These lessons assume familiarity with my Pigeon educational language, which is covered in the [first four videos of this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIbUZ3URbL0GcLBpWebtEXO5kT2_vHfBW).
